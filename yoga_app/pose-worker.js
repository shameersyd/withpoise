// glue it pulls in at runtime is a classic script — so createFromOptions() died
// with "Module scripts don't support importScripts()" and the landmarker never
// came up at all.
//
// Synchronous XHR is the one way to fetch a script synchronously, and unlike on
// the main thread it is entirely legitimate in a worker. Indirect eval puts the
// result in global scope, which is where importScripts would have put it.
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// It is not missing — it is present and throws, so the feature test has to
